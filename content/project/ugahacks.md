The University of Georgia has a rapidly growing CS department with an increase from 300 to 800 students over the last four years I wanted to give us the chance showcase how far the department has come. By hosting UGAHacks we did a couple things. We brought the entire CS and creator community together for a weekend. We gave students opportunities to flex their skills infront of potential employers. Finally, we established UGA's presence as a notable school for computer science. The event was coordinated over the course of four months where we raised over $25k in funding and worked out logistics to host over 200 participants for a weekend of awesome.
