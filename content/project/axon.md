Axon was a startup founded in October of 2014. It operated under the mission to allow tutors to grow and manage their business hassle free, while also allowing students to quickly receive help in their specific college courses (Math 1113 as opposed to just Math). Over the course of two years Axon grew to have a presence on over eight universities across five states. We helped students book over 7400 appointments and gave jobs to over 450 tutors. In early 2016, Axon was acquired by StudySocial to join their suite of educational products.
