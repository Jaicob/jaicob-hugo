A little over a year a group of UGA students, myself included, began work on establishing the univiersities space program. Today that lab has grants from the Airforce and NASA to build two cubesats(small satellites) over the course of five years. I worked on the early stages of this project while in school still where my primary roles where to teach the team how to work in an agile environment, as well as put together the requirements documentation for the project. You can read more about this endeavor [here](http://smallsat.uga.edu/).
