While in my second year of study I developed a strong interest in iOS applications and making them. Unfortunately, there wasn't much of an iOS community in Athens at the time. I developed this group for two primary reasons. One, to attract other iOS developers. Two, to teach others and spark more interest in iOS development. As a result, I was able to teach 40+ students the basics of iOS over the course of a year and begin to establish a more prominent community in the area.
